Notes:
_- Leave at least 2 threads for the operating system and other processes to avoid slow down of the whole system when running your jobs.
- Benchmark scores are PassMark.  
- Benchmark score is shown here as a clue.  Actual performance will vary with what you do.
- Mac Pro is connected to airworm4 for the internet access.  
- sudoers are Miki and Matthew on these machines
- All Linux machines run "stable" release of Debian
- For R, a repository with newer version of packages on campus is used.  Watch out for bugs as they are not "bug-free"_
